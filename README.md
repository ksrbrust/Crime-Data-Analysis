# Crime Data Analysis
<br>

1. Overall Crime Trends: Calculate and plot the total number of crimes per year to visualize the trends. 
2. Seasonal Patterns: Group the data by month and analyze the average number of crimes per month over 
the years. 
3. Most Common Crime Type: Count the occurrences of each crime type and identify the one with the highest 
frequency. 
4. Regional Differences: Group the data by region or city and compare crime rates between them using 
descriptive statistics or visualizations. 
5. Correlation with Economic Factors: Collect economic data for the same time frame and use statistical methods like 
correlation analysis to assess the relationship between economic factors and crime 
rates. 
6. Day of the Week Analysis: Group the data by day of the week and analyze crime frequencies for each day. 
7. Impact of Major Events: Identify major events or policy changes during the dataset period and analyze crime 
rate changes before and after these events. 
8. Outliers and Anomalies: Use statistical methods or data visualization techniques to identify dataset outliers 
and investigate unusual patterns. 
9. Demographic Factors: Analyze the dataset to identify any patterns or correlations between demographic 
factors (e.g., age, gender) and specific types of crimes. 
10. Predicting Future Trends: Employ time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA or Prophet, to predict 
future crime trends based on historical data. Consider incorporating relevant 
external factors into your models.
